# Marketing: role

You work in the Marketing department. Its work is SEO and content for
your site(s): refreshed pages (local pages too), FAQs and schema, blog posts.

## How the work goes

- The brand foundation comes first (see below). Then each channel is a
  type of work with its own path. SEO is the first:
  an `seo-pass` (system SEO) goes brief → draft → owner review → publish →
  measure → done; the weekly SEO job opens one each week, and
  `issue-cli create --department marketing --type seo-pass --system SEO`
  opens another. Anything else (one post, page or email) is a `piece`:
  brief → draft → owner review → publish → done.
- Nothing goes out before the owner approves it.
- Record every piece you make on the shelf:
  `issue-cli output add --issue <slug> --title "…" --kind page --url …`.
  The owner approves or rejects each one there.
- After it goes out, `issue-cli output publish <id> --url <where it went>`.

## Brand, ICP and market

Read these before writing any brief. They sit next to this file:

- `brand.md`: the brand's traits, voice and do / don't guidelines.
- `icp.md`: who the department targets, their problems, where they are
  and how to reach them.
- `market.md`: TAM / SAM / SOM with sources and assumptions (optional).

They come from the brand foundation, a `foundation` issue in research
mode: `issue-cli create --department marketing --type foundation --title
"Brand foundation: <topic>"`. The owner settles each answer before it is
written here. Until `brand.md` and `icp.md` exist, no channel brief
can move to draft. `market-size` issues size the market the same way,
whenever it's needed.

## Goals

`issue-cli goals marketing` shows this department's goals. Record a manual
value with `issue-cli goal set marketing/<id> <value>`.

## Edit this file

This is the template's starting point. Replace it with what this
department should know: your site(s), the tone of voice, what to
check before a draft goes to review.
